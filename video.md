# Video Conversion at Home

**Instructions from Lehi FamilySearch Center for doing video conversion at home**

If you still own a VCR or video camera for your videocassettes, you can do your own video conversion at home, using the same hardware and software used at the Lehi FamilySearch Center, by following these instructions:

* Purchase a video-to-USB digitizer to convert the video into a digitized format for your computer. They can often be purchased for around $15. Here is a link at Amazon to the one we use at the Lehi FamilySearch Center: [USB 2.0 Audio/Video Converter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087TDN2FL).
* Download and install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). It is free, open-source software that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux and is used for both recording and streaming video and audio.
* Follow the [instructions here by Tim Ford](https://timfordphoto.com/digitizing-vhs-tapes-using-obs/) on setting up OBS and the digitizer for converting your videos to MP4 files.
